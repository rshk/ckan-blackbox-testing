"""
Fixtures for running tests locally.

This allows running tests in a ready environment, thus saving
up some time (no virtualenv download + installation time).

For this we need:

- a virtualenv containing an installation of Ckan
- an administrative access to a postgresql database
- some way to clear indices on a Solr installation!!
